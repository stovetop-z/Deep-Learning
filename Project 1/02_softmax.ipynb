    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will teach you how to implement softmax activation and use PyTorch's automatic differentiation for training a linear classifier. You will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Implement softmax activation function** for multi-class classification with numerical stability\n",
    "2. **Use PyTorch's automatic differentiation** instead of manual gradient computation\n",
    "3. **Train a linear classifier** using default hyperparameters (lr=0.001, batch_size=32)\n",
    "4. **Test the trained classifier on MNIST dataset** and achieve >90% accuracy\n",
    "5. **Load pre-saved weights** and compare with the original linear classifier from 01_linear_feature.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: This notebook focuses on understanding softmax implementation and PyTorch's automatic differentiation. We will use PyTorch's cross-entropy loss function and optimizer for training.\n",
